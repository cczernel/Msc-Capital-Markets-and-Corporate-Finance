    "NPV stands for Net Present Value, which is a method of seeing if an investment will make or lose money based on the \"time value of money\" (e.g. 100 dollars today is worth more than 100 dollars in a year). The initial cash flow is usually negative (as its the investment amount) and the following cash flows are the returns expected each year. We apply a discount to the money earned in the future to reflect what its worth today, and that is all added up. If the NPV is positive, one would expect the venture to be profitable, and if its negative, one would expect to lose money. \n",

    "IRR stands for Internal Rate of Return, which is a percentage that \"shows\" how profitable an investment is expected to be. The IRR is the discount rate (applied in the paragraph above) at which the NPV = 0. If the IRR is higher than a typical investment savings at 3%, it would be considered a \"good\" investment."
